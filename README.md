## Overview
This is a Flask web app which fetches reviews of a particular product from Flipkart.

## Motivation
During this pandemic and lockdown, I started to learn Machine Learning algorithms and the mathematics used behind them. It was important to apply these algorithms to real world scenarios and deploy them.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7.4. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download cli to manually deploy this project.
